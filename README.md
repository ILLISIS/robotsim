# 2D Robot Simulation

This project simulates a robot moving on a 2D map using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The robot logic is kept separate from the rendering logic, making it portable to a physical robot.

## Features
- Modular robot logic (movement, sensors, etc.)
- Canvas-based 2D rendering
- Simple UI: Start, Stop, Reset

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in your browser to run the simulation.

## Project Structure
- `robot.js`: Robot logic (independent of rendering)
- `render.js`: Rendering and UI logic
- `index.html`: Main entry point
